      <description>Types of communication among microservices 1. Synchronous communication using REST 2. Asynchronous messaging  Types of communication among microservices In a microservices architecture, there are typically three types of communication patterns used for inter-service communication:
 Synchronous Asynchronous Data streaming [point to point]  1. Synchronous communication using REST 1.1 Handling failures  by using Circuit breaker pattern Network timeout if do not receive response within a configured timeout Limit the number of outstanding requests from a client to a target service   üëâ Pattern: Circuit Breaker.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this blog post, we will explore the process of decomposing a monolithic application into microservices and the benefits it brings. We will discuss various strategies, best practices, and patterns involved in this architectural transformation.
Benefits of Decomposing Monoliths  Scalability: Microservices enable individual components to scale independently, allowing you to allocate resources efficiently based on specific needs. Agility and Faster Time-to-Market: Microservices enable teams to work independently, allowing for parallel development and deployment cycles, leading to quicker feature delivery.</description>

      <description>‚≠ê Microservice pattern is an architecture that functionally decomposes an application into a set of services. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t say anything about size. Each service has focused, cohesive set of responsibility.
 Characterstics of Microservice architecture  X, Y and Z-Axis Scalability of micro services (Michael Fisher&amp;rsquo;s book - The Art of Scalability (Addison-Wesley, 2015) - Scale cube) Microservices as a form of modularity Each service has its own database  How is this different from Service oriented architecture (SOA)?</description>

      <description>Any software architecture of a computing system is the set of working components and relationsship between them. Exaple: Database, Message Broker, Server and an application running on that server.
 The 4+1 View Model Of Software Architecture More concretely, an application‚Äôs architecture can be viewed from multiple perspectives.
 üìö Phillip Krutchen: ‚ÄúArchitectural Blueprints‚ÄîThe ‚Äò4+1‚Äô View Model of Software Architecture‚Äù
  üîî A good architecture never enables you to satisfy your functional requirement, however it helps you to achieve the quality of service (non-functional and developer experience) requirements.</description>
