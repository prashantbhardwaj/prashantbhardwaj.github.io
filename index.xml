      <description>Agenda  Overview ArangoDB CouchDB Crate.IO OrientDB SednaDB Apache-Solr RethinkDB MongoDB References  Overview A document-oriented database is a database designed for storing, retrieving and managing document-oriented information, also known as semi-structured data.
Document-oriented databases are one of the main categories of NoSQL databases, and the popularity of the term &amp;ldquo;document-oriented database&amp;rdquo; has grown with the use of the term NoSQL itself. XML databases are a subclass of document-oriented databases that are optimized to work with XML documents.</description>

      <title>Cassandra : How is data deleted and what are Tombstones?</title>

      <description>Data in Cassandra is replcated on more than one node. In another terms - &amp;lsquo;Same data is copied on more than one node&amp;rsquo;. Any change in that data should be made in all the copies of that data stored on various nodes of a cluster. Same is applied for deletes as well. If a data is deleted then it should be deleted from all the nodes. But what if any node which has a copy of that data is down.</description>

      <title>Cassandra : Replication Strategies</title>
      <link>/posts/2019/09/cassandra-replication-strategies/</link>

      <description>There are two kinds of replication strategies in Cassandra.
SimpleStrategy SimpleStrategy is used when you have just one data center. SimpleStrategy places the first replica on the node selected by the partitioner. After that, remaining replicas are placed in clockwise direction in the Node ring.
NetworkTopologyStrategy NetworkTopologyStrategy is used when you have more than two data centers.
In NetworkTopologyStrategy, replicas are set for each data center separately. NetworkTopologyStrategy places replicas in the clockwise direction in the ring until reaches the first node in another rack.</description>

      <title>Cassandra : Consistency Levels List</title>

      <description>Typical values of consistency levels are -
Note - Write operation consists of writing to commit log and memtable.
   Level Write Read Usage     ALL A write must be on all replica nodes in the cluster for that partition. Returns the record after all replicas. The read operation will fail if a replica does not respond. Provides the highest consistency and the lowest availability of any other level.</description>

      <title>Cassandra : Replication Factor &amp; Consistency Level</title>
      <link>/posts/2019/09/cassandra-replication-factor-consistency-level/</link>

      <description>Replication Factor Whenever we start Cassandra, we start a cluster, which is a collection of 1 or more than one nodes. A cluster can be splitted onto more than one datacenter. Cassandraâ€™s architecture was that the hardware failure can occur at any time. Any node can be down. Even entire datacenter can go down so it is better to add more than one data centers in your cluster. Cassandra stores data replicas on multiple nodes to ensure reliability and fault tolerance.</description>

      <title>Cassandra : When not to use</title>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think that I need to explain what Cassandra is. OK, one liner is enough ! It is NoSQL database, primarily used in big data projects.
Before we start discussing scenarios where Cassandra fits very well, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss where it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit at all.
Common mistakes when using Cassandra We&amp;rsquo;ll have lots of data, let&amp;rsquo;s use Cassandra
Cassandra is not a typical database which fits in every Big Data use case.</description>
