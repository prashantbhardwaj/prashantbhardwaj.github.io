      <description>üî∞ for beginner
 As a Java developer, you have noticed the code like
logger.info(&amp;#34;user added in database : &amp;#34; + user.getUserId()); Such lines are responsible to write logs from your application, which you normally find in the log files which are created on the servers where you run your application.
 üìò Normally the classes you use in your applications to log the information come from the thing called logging facade or logging API.</description>

      <description>You do not need multiple Producers in a single service Producer is Thread Safe you can use its single instance. Now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the benefits of single Producer instance. It batches your record and it also batches batches of records to minimize the number of request to the broker servers. Single Producer Instance gives you low number of requests (read it connection) to the broker server which means better performance.</description>

      <description>Stream is unbound flow of data (call it message, event or log).
  The Streams API of Apache Kafka¬Æ, available through a Java library, can be used to build highly scalable, elastic, fault-tolerant, distributed applications and microservices. First and foremost, the Kafka Streams API allows you to create real-time applications that power your core business. It is the easiest yet the most powerful technology to process data stored in Kafka.</description>

      <description>Topics  1. Synchronous communication using REST 2. Asynchronous messaging  Types of communication among microservices In a microservices architecture, there are typically three types of communication patterns used for inter-service communication:
 Synchronous Asynchronous Data streaming [point to point]  1. Synchronous communication using REST 1.1 Handling failures  by using Circuit breaker pattern Network timeout if do not receive response within a configured timeout Limit the number of outstanding requests from a client to a target service   üëâ Pattern: Circuit Breaker.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this blog post, we will explore the process of decomposing a monolithic application into microservices and the benefits it brings. We will discuss various strategies, best practices, and patterns involved in this architectural transformation.
Benefits of Decomposing Monoliths  Scalability: Microservices enable individual components to scale independently, allowing you to allocate resources efficiently based on specific needs. Agility and Faster Time-to-Market: Microservices enable teams to work independently, allowing for parallel development and deployment cycles, leading to quicker feature delivery.</description>

      <description>‚≠ê Microservice pattern is an architecture that functionally decomposes an application into a set of services. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t say anything about size. Each service has focused, cohesive set of responsibility.
 Characterstics of Microservice architecture  X, Y and Z-Axis Scalability of micro services (Michael Fisher&amp;rsquo;s book - The Art of Scalability (Addison-Wesley, 2015) - Scale cube) Microservices as a form of modularity Each service has its own database  How is this different from Service oriented architecture (SOA)?</description>
