            <description>üî∞ for beginner
 As a Java developer, you have noticed the code like
logger.info(&amp;#34;user added in database : &amp;#34; + user.getUserId()); Such lines are responsible to write logs from your application, which you normally find in the log files which are created on the servers where you run your application.
 üìò Normally the classes you use in your applications to log the information come from the thing called logging facade or logging API.</description>

<h2 id="logging-apis-in-java">Logging APIs in Java</h2>
<p>While logging frameworks provide extensive logging capabilities, there are also logging APIs that serve as bridges or facades, allowing developers to abstract away the underlying logging implementation. This section explores three notable logging APIs in the Java ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="1-commons-logging">1. Commons Logging</h3>
<p>Commons Logging is an abstraction layer for logging in Java that provides a simple interface while allowing developers to choose their preferred logging implementation. It&rsquo;s often used in Apache projects.</p>

</code></pre></div><h3 id="3-log4j-api">3. Log4j API</h3>
<p>Log4j API is a logging API designed to work seamlessly with different logging frameworks, providing a flexible and extensible approach to logging.
Though log4J is implementation but that is written in log4j-core while log4j-api is a facade or API library. You can use any logging framework with log4j-api, like log4j-core or you can send logs from log4j-api to aother facade like slf4j.</p>

<p>Java applications leverage various logging implementations to record runtime events, errors, and performance metrics. This section explores three prominent logging implementations: java.util.logging, Log4j, and Logback.</p>
<h3 id="1-javautillogging-jul">1. java.util.logging (JUL):</h3>
<p>Java&rsquo;s built-in logging facility, JUL, is part of the Java standard library. It provides a simple and lightweight logging API, making it a natural choice for many Java applications. However, some developers find it lacking in advanced features compared to dedicated logging frameworks.</p>

</code></pre></div><h3 id="2-log4j">2. Log4j:</h3>
<p>Log4j is a robust logging framework that has been widely adopted in the Java ecosystem. Known for its configurability and flexibility, Log4j allows developers to fine-tune logging behaviors and outputs according to their application&rsquo;s requirements.</p>
<p>When here we talk about log4j, we talk about org.apache.logging.log4j with version 2.x.x, but not log4j.log4j which was predecessor of apache Log4j version 2 also called as log4j2.</p>

</code></pre></div><h3 id="3-logback">3. Logback:</h3>
<p>Logback, developed as a successor to Log4j, offers improved features and performance. It is designed to be backward-compatible with Log4j while providing a more efficient and flexible logging solution. Logback incorporates SLF4J, a simple logging facade for Java.</p>
<p>logback uses similar setup like log4j however instead of writing logback-api, it relies on slf4j-api but it has its own core logback-core. Both logback-core and slf4j-api will be pulled together into your project if you use logback-classic dependency.</p>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="which-logging-api-and-logging-framework-to-choose">Which Logging API and Logging Framework to choose</h2>
<p>üé¥
<em><strong>Logging APIs</strong></em> in Java provide a layer of abstraction that enables developers to write log statements without being tied to a specific logging implementation. Whether it&rsquo;s the simplicity of Commons Logging, the flexibility of SLF4J, or the compatibility of Log4j API, these logging APIs empower developers to choose the logging approach that best fits their application&rsquo;s needs. Understanding these APIs is crucial for seamlessly integrating logging into Java applications and facilitating efficient log management and analysis.</p>
<p>üé¥
Selecting the right <em><strong>logging implementation</strong></em> for a Java application involves considering factors such as ease of use, configurability, performance, and community support. Whether opting for the simplicity of java.util.logging, the configurability of Log4j, or the performance improvements offered by Logback, developers can tailor their logging strategy to match the specific needs of their projects. Understanding the key aspects of these logging implementations empowers developers to make informed decisions and implement effective logging solutions in their Java applications.</p>
<h2 id="things-to-consider">Things to consider</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>üç© When you write a library, use facade becuase you don&rsquo;t know that the application which is going to use your library, what logging framework that application is going to use at runtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üç© Though applications use actual framework to write their logs in log files, and framework like log4j bring their facade api with the implementation library then it doesn&rsquo;t mean you use the facade api of log4j which is log4j-api, you are free to use any facade like SLF4J, commons-logging etc. This makes changing the logging framework easy in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üç© A perticular logging framework can&rsquo;t work with all the logging facade. But developers of facade and logging framework created bridges to have inter-operatibility between popular logging facade and logging frameworks. So that they can work with each other.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="slf4j-bridge">SLF4J Bridge</h3>
<p>Now you saw that SLF4J API is widely accepted by the implementations hence you prefer SLF4J while writing the logs in your application. But it is possible that the libraries you are using in your application, are using other APIs like commons logging or log4j-api. In such cases, SLF4J has created brifges to pull the logs from all those different API logs.</p>

We will start with a basis feature set and will keep adding more features in the application as we go along. And this is a normal practice almost all companies follow in the application development process. They add/remove/enhance features, they fix issues and remove security vulnerabilities and they also increase the performance of their application. We will do all of this and will see which all AWS services help us achieve this target.</p>

            <description>You do not need multiple Producers in a single service Producer is Thread Safe you can use its single instance.

            <description>Stream is unbound flow of data (call it message, event or log).
  The Streams API of Apache Kafka¬Æ, available through a Java library, can be used to build highly scalable, elastic, fault-tolerant, distributed applications and microservices. First and foremost, the Kafka Streams API allows you to create real-time applications that power your core business. It is the easiest yet the most powerful technology to process data stored in Kafka.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Streams API of Apache Kafka¬Æ</strong>, available through a Java library, can be used to build highly scalable, elastic, fault-tolerant, distributed applications and microservices. First and foremost, the Kafka Streams API allows you to create real-time applications that power your core business. It is the easiest yet the most powerful technology to process data stored in Kafka.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your team is using Kafka as a message broker or event sourcing system or change logs or commit log; no matter what your use case is, you must be having producers and consumers (mostly Kafka Producer and Consumer APIs). Beside using Kafka Consumer API to process messages/events, Kafka STream API is another way. <strong>Let&rsquo;s discuss this approach in detail.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a wealth of interesting work happening in the stream processing area‚Äîranging from open source frameworks like <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>, <a href="https://storm.apache.org/">Apache Storm</a>, <a href="https://flink.apache.org/">Apache Flink</a>, and <a href="https://samza.apache.org/">Apache Samza</a>, to proprietary services such as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Google‚Äôs DataFlow</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> ‚Äî so it is worth outlining how Kafka Streams is similar and different from these things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of what other stream processing frameworks offer, Kafka Streams directly addresses a lot of the hard problems in stream processing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Event-at-a-time processing (not microbatch) with millisecond latency</li>
<li>Stateful processing including distributed joins and aggregations</li>
<li>A convenient DSL</li>
<li>Windowing with out-of-order data using a DataFlow-like model</li>
<li>Distributed processing and fault-tolerance with fast failover</li>
<li>Reprocessing capabilities so you can recalculate output when your code changes</li>
<li>No-downtime rolling deployments</li>
<li>And <strong>everything with a very simple architecture; which is not possible with other Open source Streaming frameworks</strong> üòÇ</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="framework-free-stream-processing">Framework-Free Stream Processing</h3>
<p>Existing streaming frameworks come with heavy and complex deployment process. You need to create a cluster of say Apache Storm and then you need to deploy your application code into the cluster which will then be copied across all the nodes.</p>
<p>Kafka Stream application, you write using simple API, without any framework. You can run it as single instance and even if you start another intsnace; no issues then Kafka will districute the load evenly to the new instances.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-does-kafka-streams-do-instead">So What Does Kafka Streams Do Instead?</h3>
<p>It does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Balance the processing load as new instances of your app are added or existing ones crash</li>
<li>Maintain local state for tables</li>
<li>Recover from failures</li>
</ol>
<p>The result is that a Kafka Streams app is just like any other service. It may have some <a href="http://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/architecture.html#state">local state on disk</a>, but that is just a cache that can be recreated if it is lost or if that instance of the app is moved elsewhere. You just use the library in your app, and start as many instances of the app as you like, and Kafka will partition up and balance the work over these instances.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-deploy-the-kafka-stream-application">How to deploy the Kafka Stream application</h3>
<p>These applications can be packaged, deployed, and monitored like any other Java application ‚Äì there is no need to install separate processing clusters or similar special-purpose and expensive infrastructure!</p>
<p>You deploy your Apache Stream application using one of the following deployment framework -</p>
<ul>
<li>Apache Mesos with a framework like Marathon</li>
<li>Kubernetes</li>
<li>YARN with something like Slider</li>
<li>Swarm from Docker</li>
<li>Various hosted container services such as ECS from Amazon</li>
<li>Cloud Foundry</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="streams-meet-tables">Streams meet tables</h2>
<h3 id="tables-is-nothing-but-a-snapshot-of-streams-processing">Tables is nothing but a snapshot of Streams processing</h3>
<p>Current state of data in a database table is nothing but a result of processing of some add-data and update-data events.
Example: When you log on in Amazon website you sometimes see your shopping cart already showing some of the items which you added in the past. If current state of your cart is showing 5 items, which means you added those 5 items one after another. Here the stream of Item-Added-Into-Cart events was processed and every time count was increased by 1. It is also possible that you deleted some of the items from the cart and another stream of Item-Deleted-From-Cart events was then processed and numbers were reduced from your cart one after another. End result in a table (in Database) is nothing but processing the inbound change events.</p>
<h3 id="ways-to-capture-change-logs">Ways to capture change logs</h3>
<p>By <a href="http://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/concepts.html#duality-of-streams-and-tables">modeling the table concept in this way</a>, Kafka Streams lets you compute derived values against the table using just the stream of changes. In other words it lets you process database change streams just as you would in case of a stream of clicks.
<a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/announcing-kafka-connect-building-large-scale-low-latency-data-pipelines">Kafka Connect</a>, a framework that is built for data capture and was newly added to Apache Kafka in the 0.9 release.</p>
<h3 id="joins-and-aggregates-are-tables-too">Joins and Aggregates are Tables Too</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs say I have a stream of user clicks coming in and I want to compute the total number of clicks for each user. Kafka Streams lets you compute this aggregation, and the set of counts that are computed, is, unsurprisingly, a table of the current number of clicks per user.</p>
<p>In terms of implementation Kafka Streams stores this derived aggregation <a href="http://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/architecture.html#state">in a local embedded key-value store</a> (RocksDB by default, but you can plug in anything). The output of the job is exactly the changelog of updates to this table. This changelog is used for high-availability of the computation, but it‚Äôs also an output that can be consumed and transformed by other Kafka Streams processing or loaded into another system using Kafka Connect.</p>
<p>They share a lot of the same operations, and can be converted back and forth just as the table/stream duality suggests, but, for example, an aggregation on a KTable will automatically handle that fact that it is made up of updates to the underlying values. This matters, as the semantics of computing a sum over a tables undergoing updates and a stream of immutable updates are totally different; likewise the semantics of joining two streams (say clicks and impressions) are totally different from the semantics of joining a stream to a table (say clicks to user accounts). By modeling these two concepts in the DSL, these details fall out automatically.</p>
<h3 id="windows-and-tables">Windows and Tables¬†</h3>
<p>Kafka Streams makes handling this really simple: the semantics of a <a href="http://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/developer-guide.html#windowing-a-stream">windowed aggregation</a> like a count is that it represents the count ‚Äúso far‚Äù for the window. It is continuously updated as new data arrives and allows the downstream receiver to decide when it is complete. And yes, this notion of an updatable quantity should seem eerily familiar: it is nothing more than a table where the window being updated is part of the key. Naturally downstream operations know that this stream represents a table, and process these refinements as they come.</p>

<h3 id="ecs-elastic-container-service">ECS (Elastic Container Service)</h3>
<p>This allows you to run Docker-enabled applications packaged as containers across a cluster of EC2 instances without requiring you to manage a complex and administratively heavy cluster management system</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>AWS Fargate</strong>: is an engine used to enable ECS to run containers without having to manage and provision instances and clusters for containers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Docker</strong> is piece of software that allows you to automate the installation and distribution of applications inside Linux Containers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>Container</strong> holds everything that an application requires to enable it to run from within it&rsquo;s isolated container package. This may include system libraries, code, system tools, run time, etcetera. But it does not include an operating system like a virtual machine does, and so reduces overhead of the actual container itself.</p>

<p>In a microservices architecture, there are typically three types of communication patterns used for inter-service communication:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synchronous</li>
<li>Asynchronous</li>
<li>Data streaming [point to point]</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Synchronous">1. Synchronous communication using REST</h2>
<h3 id="11-handling-failures">1.1 Handling failures</h3>
<ul>
<li>by using <a href="http://microservices.io/patterns/reliability/circuit-breaker.html">Circuit breaker</a> pattern</li>
<li>Network timeout if do not receive response within a configured timeout</li>
<li>Limit the number of outstanding requests from a client to a target service</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>üëâ Pattern: <strong>Circuit Breaker</strong>. <a href="http://microservices.io/patterns/reliability/circuit-breaker.html">See</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix"><strong>Netflix Hystrix</strong></a> is an open source library that implements these and other patterns. If you‚Äôre using the JVM, you should definitely consider using Hystrix when implementing RPI proxies.</p>
<h3 id="12-recovering-from-an-unavailable-service">1.2 Recovering from an unavailable service</h3>
<p>How do you respond to a call when your dependent service is down depends on the case you are implementing.</p>
<p>Though, there are following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Return error to the client telling your dependent service is down</li>
<li>Return a default response or the last cached value</li>
<li>Keep the requests stored and respond the client that request is stored and will be procedded later. Keep an API which can be invoked to check the status of stored requests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="13-service-discovery">1.3 Service discovery</h3>
<p>A service should never call another service directly, though it should search the service by name and should get the endpoint of that service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>üëâ Pattern: <strong>Service Discovery</strong>. <a href="http://microservices.io/patterns/communication-style/messaging.html">See</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Service discovery works in one of given four ways:</p>

<li><a href="http://microservices.io/patterns/server-side-discovery.html">Server-side discovery</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="asynchronous">2. Asynchronous messaging</h2>
<p>A client invokes a service using asynchronous messaging.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>üëâ Pattern: <strong>Messaging</strong>. <a href="http://microservices.io/patterns/communication-style/messaging.html">See</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="21-message">2.1 Message</h3>
<p>A message consists of a header and a message body. <a href="www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Message.html">See</a></p>
<p>There are several different kinds of messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document</strong> : A generic message that contains only data. The receiver decides how to interpret it. The reply to a command is an example of a document message.- <strong>Command</strong> : A message that‚Äôs the equivalent of an RPC request. It specifies the operation to invoke and its parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Event</strong> : A message indicating that something notable has occurred in the sender. An event is often a domain event, which represents a state change of a domain object such as an Order, or a Customer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="22-message-channel">2.2 Message Channel</h3>
<p>Messages are exchanged over a <a href="www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageChannel.html">channel</a>. A <strong>Sender</strong> sends a message over a channel on a location [called <strong>queue</strong> or <strong>topics</strong>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>üëâ Pattern: <strong>Message Channel</strong>. <a href="www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageChannel.html">See</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="23-message-brokers">2.3 Message brokers</h3>
<p>When selecting a message broker, you have various factors to consider, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supported programming languages</strong> ‚Äî You probably should pick one that supports a variety of programming languages.</li>
<li><strong>Supported messaging standards</strong> ‚Äî Does the message broker support any standards, such as AMQP and STOMP, or is it proprietary?</li>
<li><strong>Messaging ordering</strong> ‚Äî Does the message broker preserve ordering of messages?</li>
<li><strong>Delivery guarantees</strong> ‚Äî What kind of delivery guarantees does the broker make?</li>
<li><strong>Persistence</strong> ‚Äî Are messages persisted to disk and able to survive broker crashes?</li>
<li><strong>Durability</strong> ‚Äî If a consumer reconnects to the message broker, will it receive the messages that were sent while it was disconnected?</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong> ‚Äî How scalable is the message broker?</li>
<li><strong>Latency</strong> ‚Äî What is the end-to-end latency?</li>
<li><strong>Competing consumers</strong> ‚Äî Does the message broker support competing consumers?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>‚úã In a brokerless architecture, services can exchange messages directly. ZeroMQ (<a href="http://zeromq.org">http://zeromq.org</a>) is a popular brokerless messaging technology. It‚Äôs both a specification and a set of libraries for different languages. It supports a variety of transports, including TCP, UNIX-style domain sockets, and multicast.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="24-possible-ways-of-interactions-using-messages">2.4 Possible ways of interactions using messages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Request Response</li>
<li>One way event sending</li>
<li>Publish Seubscribe</li>
<li>One way push notification</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="25-benefits-of-broker-based-messaging">2.5 Benefits of Broker based messaging</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loose coupling</strong> ‚Äî A client makes a request by simply sending a message to the appropriate channel. The client is completely unaware of the service instances. It doesn‚Äôt need to use a discovery mechanism to determine the location of a service instance.</li>
<li><strong>Message buffering</strong> ‚Äî The message broker buffers messages until they can be processed. With a synchronous request/response protocol such as HTTP, both the client and service must be available for the duration of the exchange. With messaging, though, messages will queue up until they can be processed by the consumer. This means, for example, that an online store can accept orders from customers even when the order-fulfillment system is slow or unavailable. The messages will simply queue up until they can be processed.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible communication</strong> ‚Äî Messaging supports all the interaction styles described earlier.</li>
<li><strong>Explicit interprocess communication</strong> ‚Äî RPC-based mechanism attempts to make invoking a remote service look the same as calling a local service. But due to the laws of physics and the possibility of partial failure, they‚Äôre in fact quite different. Messaging makes these differences very explicit, so developers aren‚Äôt lulled into a false sense of security.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="26-downside-of-broker-based-messaging">2.6 Downside of Broker based messaging</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Potential performance bottleneck</strong> ‚Äî There is a risk that the message broker could be a performance bottleneck. Fortunately, many modern message brokers are designed to be highly scalable.</li>
<li><strong>Potential single point of failure</strong> ‚Äî It‚Äôs essential that the message broker is highly available‚Äîotherwise, system reliability will be impacted. Fortunately, most modern brokers have been designed to be highly available.</li>
<li><strong>Additional operational complexity</strong> ‚Äî The messaging system is yet another system component that must be installed, configured, and operated.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="27-handling-duplicate-messages">2.7 Handling duplicate messages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write <em>Idemotent</em> message handlers</li>
<li>Track messages and discard duplicates</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="28-message-ordering">2.8 Message ordering</h3>
<h3 id="29-transactional-messaging">2.9 Transactional messaging</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using database table as message queue</li>

<blockquote>
<p>‚úã A service is a standalone, independently deployable software component that implements some useful functionality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>üëâ A service has an API that encapsulates the implementation. The API defines operations, which are invoked by clients. There are two types of operations: commands update data, and queries retrieve data. When its data changes, a service publishes events that clients can subscribe to.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="how-is-this-different-from-service-oriented-architecture-soa">How is this different from Service oriented architecture (SOA)?</h3>
<ul>
<li>In SOA, smart pipes as Enterprise Services Bus (ESB) using heavyweight protocols like SOAP, while Microservices has Dumb pipes as a message broker, or direct service to service communication using REST or gRPC.</li>
<li>In SOA, data is global and shared, in MS database per service</li>
<li>SOA is a typical large monolith.</li>

<h2 id="microservices-architecture-pattern-language">Microservices Architecture Pattern Language</h2>
<p>It is a collection of patterns that help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>architect your application</li>
<li>decide whether to use microservice architecture or not</li>
<li>use it effectively by solving various architecture and design issues.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>üìö Christopher Alexender - A Pattern Language: Town, Buildings, Construction</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="design-patterns">Design Patterns</h2>
<p>A Pattern is reusable solution to a problem that occurs in a particular context.
Any repetable Pattern must describe the context in which that pattern is useful.</p>
<p>A commonly used pattern structure includes three especially valuable sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forces</strong>: What issues you must address when solving with the pattern</li>
<li><strong>Resulting Context</strong>: The consequences of applying the pattern
<ul>
<li>Benefits: What issues (Forces) pattern is going to solve</li>
<li>Drawback: which existing issues (forces) pattern doesn&rsquo;t solve</li>
<li>Issues: if it introduces few more issues</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Related Patterns</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Predecessor: Monolith architecture is predecessor of Microservices Architecture</li>
<li>Successor: A pattern which solves issues that has been introduced by current pattern</li>
<li>Alternative: A pattern that provides an alternative solution to this pattern. Like Microservice is alternative to Monolith.</li>
<li>Generaliztion: Any pattern which is a general solution to a common problem,</li>
<li>Specializaton: A pattern which solves a special problem. Like container patter is specialization of single service per host.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Patterns broadly can be divided into following three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure Patterns</strong>: solve problems that are mostly outside of development.</li>
<li><strong>Application Infrastructure Patterns</strong>: Infrastructure issues that also impact development</li>
<li><strong>Application Patterns</strong>: These solve problems faced by developers.</li>

            <description>Often we integrate two systems where one system is emitting events on some jms solution while another is listening a kafka topic and expecting source messages on kafka. In such cases, we write a bridge application which reads data from jms and writes on kafka.
This bridge application should satisfy following requirements -
 It should send messages on kafka without breaking the sequence of message. If jms broker goes down, it should keep trying to connect to that and whenever broker starts, application should reconnect and should start listening messages.</description>

<p><img src="/jms-to-kafka-1.PNG" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>This bridge application should satisfy following requirements -</p>
<ul>
<li>It should send messages on kafka without breaking the sequence of message.</li>
<li>If jms broker goes down, it should keep trying to connect to that and whenever broker starts, application should reconnect and should start listening messages.</li>
<li>If jms broker balances its nodes (shift master node from one to another), application should reconnect and should start listening messages.</li>
<li>If kafka goes down, it should keep trying to connect to that and either should stop reading messages from queue or should keep holding those messages which couldn&rsquo;t be send to kafka. Whenever kafka broker starts, application should reconnect and should start sending messages.</li>
<li>If application goes down, it should do that gracefully - should stop listening new messages and should finish processing of messages which are already under process.</li>
<li>In no case, a message should be lost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we&rsquo;ll be discussing 3 examples using different technologies. We are using Apache Qpid as JMS broker.</p>
<ol>
<li>JMS to Kafka using Spring JMS</li>
<li>JMS to Kafka using Apache Camel</li>
<li>JMS to Kafka using Apache Storm</li>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>A document-oriented database is a database designed for storing, retrieving and managing document-oriented information, also known as semi-structured data.</p>
<p>Document-oriented databases are one of the main categories of NoSQL databases, and the popularity of the term &ldquo;document-oriented database&rdquo; has grown with the use of the term NoSQL itself. XML databases are a subclass of document-oriented databases that are optimized to work with XML documents. Graph databases are similar, but add another layer, the relationship, which allows them to link documents for rapid traversal.</p>
<p>Document-oriented databases are inherently a subclass of the key-value store, another NoSQL database concept. The difference lies in the way the data is processed; in a key-value store, the data is considered to be inherently opaque to the database, whereas a document-oriented system relies on internal structure in the document in order to extract metadata that the database engine uses for further optimization. Although the difference is often moot due to tools in the systems, conceptually the document-store is designed to offer a richer experience with modern programming techniques.</p>
<p>Document databases contrast strongly with the traditional relational database (RDB). Relational databases generally store data in separate tables that are defined by the programmer, and a single object may be spread across several tables. Document databases store all information for a given object in a single instance in the database, and every stored object can be different from every other. This eliminates the need for object-relational mapping while loading data into the database.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to discuss some of the popular &lsquo;Document Oriented Databases&rsquo; -</p>
<h2 id="arangodb">ArangoDB</h2>
<p>(<a href="https://www.arangodb.com/">https://www.arangodb.com/</a>)</p>
<p>ArangoDB is the open-source native multi-model database for graph, document, key/value and search needs.</p>
<p>In this database -</p>
<p>developers can Map data natively to the database and access it with the best patterns for the job ‚Äì traversals, joins, search, ranking, geospatial, aggregations ‚Äì you name it. It is available in under Apache License. It supports languages like - C, .NET, Java, Python, Node.js, PHP, Scala, Go, Ruby, Elixir.</p>
<p>For architects - Polyglot persistence without the costs. Easily design, scale and adapt your architectures to changing needs and with much less effort.</p>
<p>For Data Scientiests - Combine the flexibility of JSON with semantic search and graph technology for next generation feature extraction even for large datasets.</p>
<p>ArangoDB OASIS is scalable fully managed service for ArangoDB. Which can be deployed in AWS, Google Cloud or Azure. It can be run under Docker or Kubernetes.</p>
<p>AQL (ArangoDB&rsquo;s query language) is a declarative query language letting you access the very same data with a broad range of access patterns like traversals, JOINs, search, geospatial or any combination. Everyone experienced with SQL will have an easy start with AQL and might think AQL feels more like coding.</p>
<h2 id="couchdb">CouchDB</h2>
<p>(<a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">https://couchdb.apache.org/</a>)</p>
<p>Seamless multi-master sync, that scales from Big Data to Mobile, with an Intuitive HTTP/JSON API and designed for Reliability.
Apache CouchDB‚Ñ¢ lets you access your data where you need it. The Couch Replication Protocol is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers.</p>
<p>Store your data safely, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks JSON natively and supports binary data for all your data storage needs.</p>
<p>The Couch Replication Protocol lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling offline-first user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a developer-friendly query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.</p>
<p><strong>Single node or cluster</strong> CouchDB is a terrific single-node database that works just like any other database behind an application server of your choice. Most people start with a single node CouchDB instance. More demanding projects can seamlessly upgrade to a cluster. CouchDB is also a clustered database that allows you to run a single logical database server on any number of servers or VMs. A CouchDB cluster improves on the single-node setup with higher capacity and high-availability without changing any APIs.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP/JSON</strong> CouchDB makes use of the ubiquitous HTTP protocol and JSON data format and is compatible with any software that supports them. CouchDB also works great with external tools like HTTP proxy servers, load balancers.</p>
<p><strong>Offline First Data Sync</strong> CouchDB‚Äôs unique Replication Protocol is the foundation for a whole new generation of ‚ÄúOffline First‚Äù applications for Mobile applications and other environments with challenging network infrastructures.</p>
<p><strong>Ecosystem</strong> CouchDB is built for servers (from a Raspberry Pi to big cloud installations), while PouchDB is built for mobile &amp; desktop web-browsers and Couchbase Lite is built for native iOS &amp; Android apps. And all of them can seamlessly replicate data with each other.
CouchDB is serious about data reliability.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong> Individual nodes use a crash-resistent append-only data structure. A multi-node CouchDB cluster saves all data redundantly, so it is always available when you need it.</p>
<h2 id="crateio">Crate.IO</h2>
<p>(<a href="https://crate.io/">https://crate.io/</a>)</p>

<h2 id="orientdb">OrientDB</h2>
<p>(<a href="https://orientdb.org">https://orientdb.org</a>)</p>
<p>OrientDB is the first Multi-Model Open Source NoSQL DBMS that combines the power of graphs and the flexibility of documents into one scalable, high-performance operational database.</p>
<p>Gone are the days where your database only supports a single data model. As a direct response to polyglot persistence, multi-model databases acknowledge the need for multiple data models, combining them to reduce operational complexity and maintain data consistency. Though graph databases have grown in popularity, most NoSQL products are still used to provide scalability to applications sitting on a relational DBMS. Advanced 2nd generation NoSQL products like OrientDB are the future: providing more functionality and flexibility, while being powerful enough to replace your operational DBMS.</p>

            <description>Data in Cassandra is replcated on more than one node. In another terms - &amp;lsquo;Same data is copied on more than one node&amp;rsquo;. Any change in that data should be made in all the copies of that data stored on various nodes of a cluster. Same is applied for deletes as well. If a data is deleted then it should be deleted from all the nodes. But what if any node which has a copy of that data is down.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Data in Cassandra is replcated on more than one node. In another terms - &lsquo;Same data is copied on more than one node&rsquo;. Any change in that data should be made in all the copies of that data stored on various nodes of a cluster. Same is applied for <strong>deletes</strong> as well. If a data is deleted then it should be deleted from all the nodes. But what if any node which has a copy of that data is down. When that node will come up and will be asked for that data, it will provide that data and same data will be copied on other nodes once again. Such data is called <strong>Zombie</strong> record.</p>
<p>How does Cassandra make sure that if a data is deleted than it should be deleted from all the nodes even if any node where that data is stored, is down. Cassandra manages that by creating <strong>tombstones</strong>.</p>
<p>How does these tombstones help Cassandra? Now again think about the scenario in which a data is stored on three nodes. With Local_Quorum consistency and 3 replication factor and just 2 nodes are up and running, if DELETE requests came, data got deleted from 2 live nodes, while remained saved on one node which was down when DELETE request came. Now this third node comes up and a READ request comes. This third node returns the data but other two nodes say that we had data but now we have tombstones at the place of that data. Now, cassandra knows that if two nodes have tombstones that means that data was deleted and then it repairs data on that remaining third node and deletes from that node as well.</p>
<p>Now, we understand why Cassandra creates tombstones to flagged the data as deleted so that same message can be propegated to nodes which were down when DELETE request came. But another question here - Is DELETE is the only operation, in which Cassandra creates tombstone? Answer is &lsquo;NO&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Tombstones are created in following cases -</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a CQL DELETE statement</li>
<li>Expiring data with time-to-live (TTL)</li>
<li>Using internal operations, such as Using materialized views</li>
<li>INSERT or UPDATE operations with a null value</li>
<li>UPDATE operations with a collection column</li>
</ul>
<p>When a tombstone is created, it can be marked on different parts of a partition. Based on the location of the marker, tombstones can be categorized into one of the following groups. Each category typically corresponds to one unique type of data deletion operation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Partition tombstones</li>
<li>Row tombstones</li>
<li>Range tombstones</li>
<li>ComplexColumn tombstones</li>
<li>Cell tombstones</li>
<li>TTL tombstones</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these types are explained in details <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/dse-arch/datastax_enterprise/dbInternals/archTombstones.html">on this page</a>.</p>
<p>The tombstones go through the write path, and are written to SSTables on one or more nodes. A key differentiator of a tombstone is a built-in expiration known as the grace period, set by gc_grace_seconds. At the end of its expiration period, the tombstone is deleted as part of the normal compaction process.</p>
<p>Having an excessive number of tombstones in a table can negatively impact application performance. Many tombstones often indicate potential issues with either the data model or in the application.</p>
<p><strong>Partition tombstones</strong></p>
<p>Partition tombstones are generated when an entire partition is deleted explicitly. In the CQL DELETE statement, the WHERE clause is an equality condition against the partition key.</p>
<pre><code>DELETE from cycling.rank_by_year_and_name WHERE 
 race_year = 2014 AND race_name = '4th Tour of Beijing';
</code></pre><p><strong>Row tombstones</strong></p>
<p>Row tombstones are generated when a particular row within a partition is deleted explicitly. The schema has a composite primary key that includes both the partition key and the clustering key. In the CQL DELETE statement, the WHERE clause is an equality condition against both the partition key and the clustering key columns.</p>
<pre><code>DELETE from cycling.rank_by_year_and_name WHERE 
 race_year = 2015 AND race_name = 'Giro d''Italia - Stage 11 - Forli &gt; Imola' AND rank = 2;
</code></pre><p><strong>Range tombstones</strong></p>
<p>Range tombstones occur when several rows within a partition that can be expressed through a range search are deleted explicitly. The schema has a composite primary key that includes both a partition key and a clustering key. In the CQL DELETE statement, the WHERE clause is an equality condition against the partition key, plus an inequality condition against the clustering key.
Tip: If following this tutorial from the beginning, drop the rank_by_year_and_name table and then recreate it to populate the table with the necessary data.</p>
<pre><code>DELETE from cycling.rank_by_year_and_name WHERE 
 race_year = 2015 AND race_name = 'Tour of Japan - Stage 4 - Minami &gt; Shinshu' AND rank &gt; 1;
</code></pre><p><strong>ComplexColumn tombstones</strong></p>
<p>ComplexColumn tombstones are generated when inserting or updating a collection type column, such as set, list, and map.</p>
<p>Previously we created the cyclist_career_teams table. Run the following cqlsh command to insert data into that table.</p>
<pre><code>INSERT INTO cycling.cyclist_career_teams (
     id,
     lastname,
     teams)
     VALUES (cb07baad-eac8-4f65-b28a-bddc06a0de23, 'ARMITSTEAD', { 
     'Boels-Dolmans Cycling Team','AA Drink - Leontien.nl','Team Garmin - Cervelo' } );
</code></pre><p><strong>Cell tombstones</strong></p>
<p>Cell tombstones are generated when explicitly deleting a value from a cell, such as a column for a specific row of a partition, or when inserting or updating a cell with null values, as shown in the following example.</p>
<pre><code>INSERT INTO cycling.rank_by_year_and_name (
     race_year,
     race_name,
     cyclist_name,
     rank)
     VALUES (2018, 'Giro d''Italia - Stage 11 - Osimo &gt; Imola', null, 1);
</code></pre><p><strong>TTL tombstones</strong></p>
<p>TTL tombstones are generated when the TTL (time-to-live) period expires. The TTL expiration marker can occur at either the row or cell level. However, DSE marks TTL data differently from tombstone data that was explicitly deleted. Even if a partition has only a single row (with no clustering key), the TTL mark is still made at the row level.</p>
<p>The following statement sets TTL for an entire row.</p>
<pre><code>INSERT INTO cycling.cyclist_career_teams (
     id,
     lastname,
     teams)
     VALUES (
       e7cd5752-bc0d-4157-a80f-7523add8dbcd, 
       'VAN DER BREGGEN', 
       {
         'Rabobank-Liv Woman Cycling Team',
         'Sengers Ladies Cycling Team',
         'Team Flexpoint' 
        }
      ) 
     USING TTL 1;
</code></pre><p>The following statement sets TTL for a single cell.</p>
<pre><code>UPDATE cycling.rank_by_year_and_name USING TTL 1
  SET cyclist_name = 'Cloudy Archipelago' WHERE race_year = 2018 AND 
  race_name = 'Giro d''Italia - Stage 11 - Osimo &gt; Imola' AND rank = 1;
</code></pre>]]></content>

            <description>There are two kinds of replication strategies in Cassandra.
SimpleStrategy is used when you have just one data center. SimpleStrategy places the first replica on the node selected by the partitioner. After that, remaining replicas are placed in clockwise direction in the Node ring.
NetworkTopologyStrategy is used when you have more than two data centers.
In NetworkTopologyStrategy, replicas are set for each data center separately. NetworkTopologyStrategy places replicas in the clockwise direction in the ring until reaches the first node in another rack.</description>

<p>This strategy tries to place replicas on different racks in the same data center. This is due to the reason that sometimes failure or problem can occur in the rack. Then replicas on other nodes can provide data.</p>

            <description>In a production system, it is advisable to have three or more Cassandra nodes in each data center, and the default replication factor should be three. As a general rule, the replication factor should not exceed the number of Cassandra nodes in the cluster. If there are 3 nodes in your cluster then how can you store data on more than three nodes?
If you add additional Cassandra nodes to the cluster, the default replication factor is not affected.</description>

<p>In a production system, it is advisable to have three or more Cassandra nodes in each data center, and the default replication factor should be three. As a general rule, the replication factor should not exceed the number of Cassandra nodes in the cluster. If there are 3 nodes in your cluster then how can you store data on more than three nodes?</p>
<p>If you add additional Cassandra nodes to the cluster, the default replication factor is not affected.</p>
<p>For example, if you increase the number of Cassandra nodes to six, but leave the replication factor at three, that means data will be replicated on just three nodes not on all six nodes. If you are adding of deleting nodes in a cluster, it is your responsibility to change the replication factor. If a node goes down, a higher replication factor means a higher probability that the data on the node exists on one of the remaining nodes. The downside of a higher replication factor is an increased latency on data writes.</p>
<p>All the nodes exchange information with each other using Gossip protocol. Gossip is a protocol in Cassandra by which nodes can communicate with each other.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of replication strategies in Cassandra. Which are mentioned <a href="../cassandra-replication-strategy/">here</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Cassandra consistency level is defined as the minimum number of Cassandra nodes that must acknowledge a read or write operation before the operation can be considered successful. Different consistency levels can be assigned to different Edge keyspaces.</p>
<p><a href="../cassandra-consistency-levels-list/">This table describes various types of write/read consistency levels. </a></p>
<p>When connecting to Cassandra for read and write operations, generally used consistency level value is LOCAL_QUORUM. However, some keyspaces are defined to use a consistency level of one.</p>
<p>The calculation of the value of LOCAL_QUORUM for a data center is:</p>
<pre><code>LOCAL_QUORUM = (replication_factor/2) + 1 
</code></pre><p>As described above, the default replication factor for an Edge production environment with three Cassandra nodes is three. Therefore, the default value of LOCAL_QUORUM = (3/2) +1 = 2 (the value is rounded down to an integer).</p>
<p>With LOCAL_QUORUM = 2, at least two of the three Cassandra nodes in the data center must respond to a read/write operation for the operation to succeed. For a three node Cassandra cluster, the cluster could therefore tolerate one node being down per data center.</p>
<p>By specifying the consistency level as LOCAL_QUORUM, Edge avoids the latency required by validating operations across multiple data centers. If a keyspace used the Cassandra QUORUM value as the consistency level, read/write operations would have to be validated across all data centers.</p>
<p>If you add additional Cassandra nodes to the cluster, the consistency level is not affected.
Consistency level can be different for read and write queries however it is advised to use same consistency level for read and write.</p>

            <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think that I need to explain what Cassandra is. OK, one liner is enough ! It is NoSQL database, primarily used in big data projects.
Before we start discussing scenarios where Cassandra fits very well, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss where it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit at all.
We&amp;rsquo;ll have lots of data, let&amp;rsquo;s use Cassandra
Cassandra is not a typical database which fits in every Big Data use case. In some no big data cases also it can fit very well.</description>

<p>Before we start discussing scenarios where Cassandra fits very well, let&rsquo;s discuss where it doesn&rsquo;t fit at all.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>We&rsquo;ll have lots of data, let&rsquo;s use Cassandra</strong></p>
<p>Cassandra is not a typical database which fits in every Big Data use case. In some no big data cases also it can fit very well. At other side it can be a bad choice even in a big data project.
Cassandra is useless unless you need to read a lot of data in one go and that data is stored side by side so that a single seek read can grab entire data you need.
It is very bad if your query is returning just one or few rows and you are making lot of queries.</p>
<p><strong>Our organization has Cassandra running as a service so it is easy for us to atleast start with it</strong></p>
<p>So what? Let other teams use but you stay away if it doesn&rsquo;t suite you.
Sometime MySQL can be a better choice than Cassandra.</p>
<p><strong>Ohh ! CQL is just like SQL. Great !!, now we can query any data !</strong></p>
<p>No this is incorrect. CQL is not SQL. You can&rsquo;t join tables in CQL. There are many other differences too.</p>
<p><strong>Ohh no, Cassandra doesn&rsquo;t allow manipulation of data during read or write</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it just gives you what is stored or simply writes what you give it. No data manupulation on the fly.</p>
<p><strong>WoW, this User defined functions are great things, let&rsquo;s create many</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t keep Cassandra coordinator busy in doing things which are not related to Cassandra. This will impact the performance of your Cassandra cluster.</p>

<p>The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra&rsquo;s support for replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.</p>
<h2 id="h2charactersticsh2"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Characterstics<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p><strong>Fault tolerant</strong>
Data is automatically replicated to multiple nodes for fault-tolerance. Replication across multiple data centers is supported. Failed nodes can be replaced with no downtime.</p>
<p><strong>Performant</strong>
Cassandra consistently outperforms popular NoSQL alternatives in benchmarks and real applications, primarily because of fundamental architectural choices.</p>
<p><strong>Decentralized</strong>
There are no single points of failure. There are no network bottlenecks. Every node in the cluster is identical.</p>
<p><strong>Scalable</strong>
Some of the largest production deployments include Apple&rsquo;s, with over 75,000 nodes storing over 10 PB of data, Netflix (2,500 nodes, 420 TB, over 1 trillion requests per day), Chinese search engine Easou (270 nodes, 300 TB, over 800 million requests per day), and eBay (over 100 nodes, 250 TB).</p>
<p><strong>Durable</strong>
Cassandra is suitable for applications that can&rsquo;t afford to lose data, even when an entire data center goes down.</p>
<p><strong>You&rsquo;re in control</strong>
Choose between synchronous or asynchronous replication for each update. Highly available asynchronous operations are optimized with features like Hinted Handoff and Read Repair.</p>
<p><strong>Elastic</strong>
Read and write throughput both increase linearly as new machines are added, with no downtime or interruption to applications.</p>
<p><strong>Professionally Supported</strong>
Cassandra support contracts and services are available from third parties.</p>

<p><img src="/caas/cass-write.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>Entire write happens in following steps</p>
<ul>
<li>Logging data in the commit log</li>
<li>Writing data to the memtable</li>
<li>Flushing data from the memtable</li>
<li>Storing data on disk in SSTables</li>
<li>Compaction</li>
</ul>
<p>First thing it does, is writing the data in commit log, which is on disc, because of that it is durable.
It is append only log which is sequencial write and that is the reason that write in Cassandra is super fast.</p>
<p>Then it writes data in memtable. The memtable is a write-back cache of data partitions that Cassandra looks up by key. The more a table is used, the larger its memtable needs to be. Cassandra can dynamically allocate the right amount of memory for the memtable or you can manage the amount of memory being utilized yourself.</p>
<p>Row in memtable can have 2 billion columns. After writing data in the column it sends acknowldgement back to client.</p>
<p>The memtable, unlike a write-through cache, stores writes until reaching a limit, and then is flushed. When memtable contents exceed a configurable threshold, the memtable data, which includes indexes, is put in a queue to be flushed to disk. To flush the data, Cassandra sorts memtables by partition key and then writes the data to disk sequentially. The process is extremely fast because it involves only a commitlog append and the sequential write.</p>
<p>SSTables are immutable, not written to again after the memtable is flushed. Consequently, a partition is typically stored across multiple SSTable files So, if a row is not in memtable, a read of the row needs look-up in all the SSTable files. This is why read in Cassandra is much slower than write.</p>
<p>Data in the commit log is purged after its corresponding data in the memtable is flushed to the SSTable. The commit log is for recovering the data in memtable in the event of a hardware failure.</p>
<p>as we know that data for a row in SSTable is not in just one SSTable. Whenever data in a row is updated Cassandra writes a new timestamped version of the inserted or updated data in another SSTable. Cassandra also does not delete in place because the SSTable is immutable. Instead, Cassandra marks data to be deleted using a tombstone. Tombstones exist for a configured time period defined by the gc_grace_seconds value set on the table. During compaction, there is a temporary spike in disk space usage and disk I/O because the old and new SSTables co-exist. This diagram depicts the compaction process:</p>
<p><img src="/caas/caas-compaction.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>Compaction merges the data in each SSTable data by partition key, selecting the latest data for storage based on its timestamp. Cassandra can merge the data performantly, without random IO, because rows are sorted by partition key within each SSTable. After evicting tombstones and removing deleted data, columns, and rows, the compaction process consolidates SSTables into a single file. The old SSTable files are deleted as soon as any pending reads finish using the files. Disk space occupied by old SSTables becomes available for reuse.</p>
<p>Data input to SSTables is sorted to prevent random I/O during SSTable consolidation. After compaction, Cassandra uses the new consolidated SSTable instead of multiple old SSTables, fulfilling read requests more efficiently than before compaction. The old SSTable files are deleted as soon as any pending reads finish using the files. Disk space occupied by old SSTables becomes available for reuse.</p>
<p>Although no random I/O occurs, compaction can still be a fairly heavyweight operation. During compaction, there is a temporary spike in disk space usage and disk I/O because the old and new SSTables co-exist. To minimize deteriorating read speed, compaction runs in the background.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><img src="/caas/caas-read.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>Application client can send data request to any node of your cluster. That node then becomes coordinator for that request. Now it is coordinator&rsquo;s job to talk to other nodes, get the data and return it to client.
When a read request starts its journey, the data‚Äôs partition key is used to find what nodes have the data. After that, the request is sent to a number of nodes set by the tunable consistency level for reads. Then, on each node, in a certain order, Cassandra checks different places that can have the data.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is the memtable.</li>
<li>If the data is not there, it checks the row key cache (if enabled),</li>
<li>then the bloom filter and</li>
<li>then the partition key cache (also if enabled).</li>
<li>If the partition key cache has the needed partition key, Cassandra goes straight to the compression offsets,</li>
<li>and after that it finally fetches the needed data out of a certain SSTable.</li>
<li>If the partition key wasn‚Äôt found in partition key cache, Cassandra checks the partition summary</li>
<li>and then the primary index before going to the compression offsets and extracting the data from the SSTable.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the data with the latest timestamp is located, it is fetched to the coordinator. Here, another stage of the read occurs. As we‚Äôve stated here, Cassandra has issues with data consistency. The thing is that you write many data replicas and you may read their old versions instead of the newer ones. But Cassandra doesn‚Äôt ignore these consistency-related problems: it tries to solve them with a read repair process. The nodes that are involved in the read return results. Then, Cassandra compares these results based on the ‚Äúlast write wins‚Äù policy. Hence, the new data version is the main candidate to be returned to the user, while the older versions are rewritten to their nodes. But that‚Äôs not all. In the background, Cassandra checks the rest of the nodes that have the requested data (because the replication factor is often bigger than consistency level). When these nodes return results, the DB also compares them and the older ones get rewritten. Only after this, the user actually gets the result.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You run Cassandra in a cluster with more than one nodes. Which not only gives reliability in case any node goes down but this reliability comes with the fact that data of each node is replicated on other nodes. That is why if any node goes down, other nodes start serving that data.</p>
<p><img src="/caas/caas-cluster.png" alt="alt text"></p>

<li>Client writes local</li>

<p><strong>GitHub</strong> came up with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages service</a>, which hosts static web content free of cost. For Tech bloggers and for those who are trying to make their hands dirty in static web content creation, this is the best service at this moment. Read tagline of GitHub Pages -</p>
<p><img src="/GitHub-pages-intro.PNG" alt="alt text"></p>
<p><strong>GoHugo</strong> is one of the most popular open-source <a href="https://gohugo.io/">static site generators</a>. With its amazing speed and flexibility, GoHugo makes building websites fun again. It is <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">theme</a> based framework. You write markdown files and hugo creates static html by blending the content written in markdown files with the theme you selected. I am using <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/">hello-friend-ng</a> theme for this website. And this entire post is written in single markdown file. Result is in-front of you. In future, I can choose any other theme and same content then will be presented differently on UI.</p>
<p><img src="/Hugo-intro.PNG" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>Now, In this post I will explain the step by step procedure to create a personal blog site using Hugo and then hosting this on GitHubPages.</p>
<h3 id="step-1---repository-setup-in-github">Step 1 - Repository setup in GitHub</h3>
<h4 id="11---to-create-a-user-page-site-on-github-pages-create-a-repository-using-the-naming-scheme--ltusernamegtgithubio">1.1 - To create a User Page site on GitHub Pages, create a repository using the naming scheme  &lt;username&gt;.github.io.</h4>
<p>My GitHub username is prashantbhardwaj hence I created a repository with the name as <em>prashantbhardwaj.github.io</em>.
Now, when I will push any static web contents like HTML, CSS or JS files, those files will be hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed on this <a href="https://prashantbhardwaj.github.io">URL</a>. Please Note - Content from the master branch will be used to publish your GitHub Pages site.</p>
<h4 id="12---now-create-one-more-repository-to-keep-the-code-of-your-hugo-website-project">1.2 - Now create one more repository to keep the code of your Hugo Website project.</h4>
<p>GoHugo will be used to create static content of your website. To do so, you need a github repository to keep you Hugo project code. Finally that generated static content will be pushed into &lt;username&gt;.github.io repository. You can give any name for your GoHugo project repository. I chose <em>website</em>.</p>
<h4 id="please-note">Please note</h4>
<p>These two repository will remain blank until step 3. Later we will use these repositories to push static website content and the GoHugo code which will be used to generate these static web content.</p>
<h3 id="step-2---gohugo-installation">Step 2 - GoHugo installation</h3>
<p>To install GoHugo in your local machine, follow steps mentioned on this <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/">page</a>.</p>
<h3 id="step-3---learn-gohugo">Step 3 - Learn GoHugo</h3>
<p>Check this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&amp;list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3">YouTube playlist</a>, to learn GoHugo, step by step. During this learning exercise you will also create your GoHugo website project.</p>
<h3 id="step-4---link-your-gohugo-project-to-your-github-repository">Step 4 - Link your GoHugo project to your github repository.</h3>
<p>I hope during learning GoHugo by watching the youtube clips mentioned in previous step, you created your project. Now, it is time to link your GoHugo project with your website project repository you created under step 1.2.

<h3 id="step-5---link-your-theme-subproject-with-its-github-repository">Step 5 - Link your theme subproject with its github repository.</h3>
<p>I hope during learning GoHugo by watching the youtube clips mentioned in previous step, you created your project and if so then probably you downloaded your chosen theme from it&rsquo;s GitHub repository. For my project, I cloned hello-friend-ng theme from <a href="https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git">it&rsquo;s github repository</a> in my project&rsquo;s themes directory. As mentioned on <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/">hello-friend-ng</a> website, I used following command to link this theme subproject with my main website project -</p>
<p><code>$ git submodule add https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git themes/hello-friend-ng</code></p>
<p>There is a benefit of linking your theme subproject with your theme&rsquo;s GitHub repository - whenever there will be any changes in your theme&rsquo;s code, you can very easily download them by using <code>git clone</code> command.</p>
<h3 id="step-6---generate-static-content-of-your-website">Step 6 - Generate static content of your website</h3>
<p><code>hugo -t theme-name</code> command generates static content of your website in <code>/public</code> directory. If you will link this directory with the repository created under step 1.1 the by just pushing that generated static web content, your website will be hosted on GitHubPages. Steps to link your <code>/public</code> with GitHub repository are mentioned on your GitHub repository home page. Open that home page on your GitHub repository website and follow them.</p>
<p>Now add this github project as submodule with your main website project. Detailed steps are mentioned <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/">here</a>.</p>
